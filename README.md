### Installation
By default, the project should have already been initialized.
If your database has not been initialized (you lack admin account for example),
please navigate to the /init/ page, which makes a simple initialization of the database.

Note that /init/ is not considered a part of the project from a security viewpoint, 
as it would not need to exist on an actual server.

### Default users
* admin (password: ks0prUxWDwPJv96, account: 55-0080-0810)

For more users, please create them through the log in page.
